# Acknowledgments

## Academic Supervision

This research project was conducted during an internship at the **University of Amsterdam** (UvA), Department of Political Science.

**Primary Supervisor**: Dr. Wouter Schakel

Dr. Schakel's research focuses on political inequality, representation, and the relationship between economic inequality and political attitudes. His guidance shaped the theoretical framework and analytical approach of this study.

- The broader literature on contextual effects on political attitudes

## Personal Note

I am grateful to Dr. Schakel for his mentorship and guidance throughout this project. The experience of working at the University of Amsterdam significantly shaped my understanding of quantitative social science research and multilevel modeling techniques.

This project represents my attempt to contribute to the academic conversation about how local contexts shape political attitudes. While the findings suggest limited neighborhood effects in the Dutch context, I hope this work demonstrates rigorous methodology and transparent analysis.
