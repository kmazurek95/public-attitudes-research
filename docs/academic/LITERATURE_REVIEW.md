# Literature Review: Contextual Effects on Redistribution Preferences

## Introduction

Public concern about income inequality is high and often rising, but support for concrete redistributive policies remains fragmented. Recent research suggests that attitudes toward redistribution are filtered through perceived inequality, meritocratic beliefs, and local experiences rather than national inequality levels alone.

This review situates the current study within three core strands of the literature:
1. Perceptions and misperceptions of inequality
2. Beliefs and meritocracy
3. Experiences and inferential spaces

## Theoretical Framework

### The "Inferential Spaces" Hypothesis

Mijs (2018) proposes that individuals form beliefs about societal inequality based on their immediate social environments - their "inferential spaces." The key mechanism is:

> **Local observation → Perceived inequality → Redistribution preferences**

People living in economically homogeneous environments may underestimate societal inequality, while those in diverse environments develop more accurate perceptions. This framework suggests that neighborhood-level inequality should be more predictive of attitudes than national-level statistics.

### Why Local Context Might Matter

1. **Information availability**: People have more direct information about their local environment
2. **Social comparison**: Reference groups are often local (neighbors, coworkers)
3. **Visibility**: Local inequality is observable; national inequality is abstract
4. **Daily experience**: Repeated exposure to local conditions shapes beliefs

## Strand 1: Perceptions and Misperceptions

### Key Findings

Recent studies reinforce that **perceived inequality**—not actual inequality—is the more consistent predictor of concern and redistributive attitudes.

- **Hauser & Norton (2017)**: Cross-national reviews document large, patterned misperceptions of income and wealth distributions. Underestimation of inequality is common in countries like the US and UK.

- **Cruces, Perez-Truglia, & Tetaz (2013)**: Biased perceptions of income distribution affect preferences for redistribution. People anchor on their local reference groups.

- **Recent survey experiments** (2024-2025): Information treatments correcting beliefs about income or wealth distributions show asymmetric effects:
  - Information about higher-than-expected wealth concentration can *increase* perceived unfairness
  - Information that income inequality is "less bad than thought" can *decrease* concern
  - Effects are mediated by prior beliefs and political orientation

### Implications for This Study

- The relationship between actual neighborhood inequality and attitudes may be weak if perceptions don't align with reality
- "Correcting perceptions does not often work" if information is abstract, nationally framed, or filtered through existing beliefs
- Different types of information (income vs. wealth; group-based vs. overall inequality) have distinct effects

## Strand 2: Beliefs and Meritocracy

### Meritocracy as Legitimization

Meritocratic beliefs—the idea that outcomes reflect effort and talent—legitimize inequality and dampen demand for redistribution.

- **Mijs (2021)**: "The paradox of inequality: Income inequality and belief in meritocracy go hand in hand." Countries with higher inequality often have stronger meritocratic beliefs.

- **"Does support for redistribution mean what we think it means?" (2024)**: This critical piece argues that generic survey items about "reducing inequality" mask substantial disagreement over specific policies. Many respondents express egalitarian sentiments without endorsing concrete tax-and-transfer changes.

- **Deservingness heuristics**: Attitudes hinge on whether inequality is seen as:
  - *Deserved* (effort-based) → lower support for redistribution
  - *Undeserved* (luck, background, discrimination) → higher support

### The Role of Social Context

Meritocratic beliefs are particularly prevalent in **homogeneous social contexts** where residents have similar socioeconomic backgrounds. This creates a feedback loop:
- Homogeneous environments → meritocratic narratives sustained
- Diverse environments → structural barriers more visible → less meritocracy

### Implications for This Study

- Neighborhood composition may affect redistribution preferences *indirectly* through beliefs
- The effect of neighborhood poverty may differ depending on whether residents attribute it to individual failings or structural factors
- Simple "support for redistribution" measures may not capture nuanced attitudes

## Strand 3: Experiences and Local Contexts

### Empirical Evidence

The newer literature reinforces the focus on experiences and local context as key mechanisms.

- **Newman, Johnston, & Lown (2015)**: Local poverty exposure affects policy attitudes in the US. Living near poor people increases awareness of structural barriers.

- **Larsen (2016)**: Small but significant neighborhood effects on redistribution attitudes in Denmark (ICC ~5%).

- **Senik (2009)**: The "tunnel effect" - local comparisons matter for subjective well-being and attitudes. Exposure to upward mobility can increase tolerance for inequality.

### Measurement Challenges

- **Perceived Economic Inequality Scale** (Italy, 2024): Recent measurement efforts show that perceived inequality is multi-dimensional and sensitive to everyday experience, not just national Gini statistics.

- **Longitudinal studies**: Perceptions of inequality and meritocracy evolve together over time, sometimes in counterintuitive ways (e.g., perceived inequality declining while acceptance of market-based inequality rises).

### The Dutch Context

Several factors may explain why neighborhood effects might be **weaker in the Netherlands** compared to other countries:

1. **Relatively egalitarian society**: Lower residential segregation than US/UK
2. **Strong welfare state**: Reduces visible inequality
3. **High geographic mobility**: Weakens neighborhood attachment
4. **Media and internet**: May override local observations
5. **Small geographic units**: Dutch buurten may be too small to constitute meaningful "inferential spaces"

## Recent Developments (2024-2025)

### Pew Research Center (2025)

A survey across 36 countries finds:
- Majorities view economic inequality as a major challenge
- Wide variation in perceived causes (individual effort vs. structural factors)
- Support for specific redistributive policies varies more than general concern

### Post-COVID Findings

Early evidence from COVID-era studies suggests:
- The pandemic highlighted inequalities and sometimes increased stated concern
- However, this did not produce a uniform surge in support for permanent, structural redistribution
- Support focused on temporary, crisis-linked measures
- Consistent with the argument that rising inequality does not automatically translate into durable redistributive demand

## Summary of the Literature

| Strand | Key Insight | Implication |
|--------|-------------|-------------|
| Perceptions | Perceived inequality matters more than actual | Weak effects if perceptions don't align with reality |
| Beliefs | Meritocracy dampens redistribution demand | Context shapes beliefs, not just direct preferences |
| Experiences | Local context shapes inference | Neighborhood effects should be detectable |

## What This Study Tests

1. **Does neighborhood income composition predict redistribution preferences?** (H1)
2. **Are neighborhood effects stronger than higher-level (municipality) effects?** (H2)
3. **Do effects persist after controlling for individual characteristics?** (H3)

If the inferential spaces hypothesis is correct, we should observe:
- Significant neighborhood-level variance (ICC > 5%)
- Positive effect of neighborhood poverty on redistribution support
- Effects robust to individual-level controls

If effects are weak or null, this suggests:
- Other mechanisms (media, national discourse) dominate
- Dutch context differs from US/UK where most research was conducted
- Measurement limitations in survey data
