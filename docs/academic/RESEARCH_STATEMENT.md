## Research Interests

My research interests center on the **political economy of inequality**—specifically, how individuals form attitudes about economic distribution and what role local context plays in shaping these beliefs. I am drawn to questions that bridge sociology, political science, and quantitative methodology:

- Why doesn't rising inequality generate proportional demand for redistribution?
- How do immediate social environments ("inferential spaces") shape beliefs about meritocracy and fairness?
- What methodological approaches best capture contextual effects on individual attitudes?

These questions matter because they address a fundamental puzzle in democratic theory: if majorities would benefit from redistribution, why don't they consistently support it?

## This Project: Testing the Inferential Spaces Hypothesis

### Motivation

During my internship at the University of Amsterdam under Dr. Wouter Schakel, I investigated whether neighborhood-level income composition influences redistribution preferences in the Netherlands. This project was motivated by Mijs' (2018) theoretical framework, which proposes that people form inequality beliefs based on their immediate social environments rather than abstract national statistics.

### Approach

I employed **multilevel regression models** to analyze survey data (N = 8,013) linked to official neighborhood statistics from Statistics Netherlands. The hierarchical structure—individuals nested within neighborhoods, districts, and municipalities—required appropriate statistical methods that correctly partition variance across levels.

### Key Findings

The analysis revealed that only **3.4% of variance** in redistribution preferences occurs between neighborhoods. While a bivariate relationship exists between neighborhood poverty concentration and redistribution support, this association becomes non-significant after controlling for individual characteristics. This suggests **compositional rather than contextual effects**—the apparent neighborhood influence reflects who lives where, not neighborhood influence on residents.

### Contribution

This null finding is substantively important. It suggests that:

1. **The inferential spaces hypothesis may be context-dependent**: Effects documented in the US may not generalize to more egalitarian European welfare states
2. **Selection effects may dominate**: People may sort into neighborhoods based on pre-existing attitudes
3. **Cross-sectional designs have limitations**: Longitudinal data is needed to establish causal mechanisms

## Methodological Skills Developed

This project advanced my expertise in several areas critical for quantitative social science:

### Multilevel Modeling
- Random intercept models with 2-4 nesting levels
- Variance decomposition and ICC calculation
- Cross-level interaction effects
- Comparison across statistical software (R/lme4, Python/statsmodels)

### Data Integration
- Linking survey microdata to administrative records
- API integration with national statistics agencies (CBS StatLine)
- Geographic identifier construction and validation

### Reproducible Research
- Pipeline orchestration (R targets, modular Python)
- Dual-software implementation for robustness
- Version control and documentation practices

### Research Communication
- Interactive dashboard development (Streamlit, Shiny)
- Academic manuscript preparation
- Translation of technical findings for multiple audiences

## Future Research Directions

This project has shaped my thinking about several promising research directions:

### 1. Longitudinal Designs for Causal Identification

The cross-sectional limitation of my current work points to the need for panel data or natural experiments. Future research could exploit:
- Residential mobility as a quasi-experiment
- Housing policy changes that alter neighborhood composition
- Longitudinal surveys tracking attitude change over time

### 2. Comparative Analysis Across Welfare Regimes

My Dutch findings may differ from US/UK contexts due to institutional differences. A comparative project could test whether:
- Neighborhood effects are stronger in more unequal societies
- Welfare state generosity moderates local context effects
- Different geographic scales matter in different national contexts

### 3. Mechanisms Linking Context to Attitudes

The inferential spaces framework suggests **beliefs** mediate between context and preferences. Future work should directly measure:
- Meritocratic beliefs as a mediating variable
- Social comparison processes in daily life
- Information environments and media consumption

### 4. Alternative Measures of Local Inequality

Administrative poverty rates may not capture what residents actually observe. Alternative approaches include:
- Subjective perceptions of neighborhood inequality
- Visible markers of wealth/poverty (housing quality, cars, amenities)
- Social network diversity rather than geographic proximity

## Why Doctoral Study?

This project demonstrates my capacity for independent research, but it also revealed how much more I want to learn. Doctoral training would allow me to:

1. **Deepen methodological expertise**: Particularly in causal inference, longitudinal methods, and computational approaches
2. **Engage with theoretical debates**: The inequality-attitudes literature is rich and evolving; I want to contribute to it
3. **Develop an independent research agenda**: Building on this project toward a coherent program of work
4. **Join a scholarly community**: Collaborating with faculty and peers who share these interests

## Conclusion

My research on neighborhood effects and redistribution preferences demonstrates both my technical capabilities and my substantive interests. The null finding—that neighborhoods explain little variance in the Dutch context—is itself a contribution, challenging assumptions about the universality of contextual effects. I am eager to pursue these questions further through doctoral study, developing the skills and knowledge to make meaningful contributions to our understanding of inequality attitudes.
